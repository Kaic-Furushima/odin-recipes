    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This ice cream sandwich cake was renamed as "The Best Dessert I've Ever Eaten" by my daughter this Memorial Day. I had made it before, but my husband ate all of it before she had a chance to get a taste! My husband doesn't like when I take this desert to a large gathering because it means he won't have any leftovers!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>24 vanilla ice cream sandwiches, unwrapped</li>
      <li>2 (8 ounce) containers whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) jar hot fudge ice cream topping, warmed</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) jar caramel ice cream topping</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped pecans, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Arrange a layer of ice cream sandwiches in the bottom of a 9x13-inch dish; top with a layer of whipped topping, hot fudge topping, and caramel topping.</li>
      <li>Repeat layering with remaining ice cream sandwiches, whipped topping, hot fudge topping, and caramel topping, ending with a top layer of whipped topping. Sprinkle with pecans.</li>
      <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and freeze until set, about 30 minutes. Slice and serve with your favorite toppings!</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
